# quantum-database-optimizer
Quantum Database Optimizer explores quantum computing’s potential in database optimization. It implements Grover’s Search, QAOA, and Quantum Clustering to enhance query speed, optimization, and clustering performance. Built with Qiskit and Python, this project demonstrates quantum’s power in real-world database operations.
