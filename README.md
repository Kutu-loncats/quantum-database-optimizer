# Quantum Database Optimizer

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the potential of **Quantum Computing** and **Quantum-Inspired Algorithms** in optimizing database operations. By using algorithms like **Grover's Search**, **Quantum-Inspired Optimization (QAOA)**, and **Quantum Clustering**, the goal is to improve the efficiency of various database processes, such as search, query optimization, and clustering, which are critical in handling large datasets.

The project contains implementations for these quantum algorithms, written in Python using **Qiskit** — an open-source quantum computing framework. These algorithms can be applied to real-world database optimization problems and are designed to work in quantum computing simulations.

## Algorithms Implemented

### 1. **Grover's Search Algorithm**
Grover's algorithm is a quantum algorithm that can search an unsorted database or solve unstructured search problems in **O(√N)** time, which is exponentially faster than classical search algorithms that take **O(N)** time.

#### **grover_search.py**
```python
# Grover's Search Algorithm for Database Search Optimization

from qiskit import Aer, QuantumCircuit, transpile, assemble
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram

N = 16  # Database size (Number of items)
target_index = 5  # The target index we are searching for

# Create a quantum circuit with N qubits
qc = QuantumCircuit(N)

# Create a superposition of all possible states
qc.h(range(N))

# Oracle: Mark the target state
qc.cz(target_index, target_index)

# Diffusion operator (Inversion about the mean)
qc.h(range(N))
qc.x(range(N))
qc.h(N-1)
qc.cx(range(N-1), N-1)
qc.h(range(N))
qc.x(range(N))

# Measure the result
qc.measure_all()

# Simulate the circuit
backend = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
tqc = transpile(qc, backend)
qobj = assemble(tqc)
result = backend.run(qobj).result()

# Display the result
counts = result.get_counts()
print(f"Result: {counts}")
plot_histogram(counts)
