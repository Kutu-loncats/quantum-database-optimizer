# Quantum Database Optimizer

The **Quantum Database Optimizer** project demonstrates how quantum computing algorithms can be used to optimize database operations. By leveraging quantum-inspired algorithms such as **Grover's Search**, **Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)**, and **Quantum Clustering**, this project aims to enhance the performance of traditional database management systems. 

The goal is to improve database query speed, optimization of complex queries, and clustering techniques, which are often bottlenecks in working with large datasets.

## Project Overview

In the world of database management, certain operations such as searching unstructured data, optimizing complex queries, and clustering large datasets can be time-consuming. This project demonstrates the potential of quantum computing to accelerate these processes.

Quantum computing offers potential solutions to these problems by leveraging quantum mechanics, which can outperform traditional classical computing in specific tasks. In this project, we explore how quantum computing principles can be applied to improve database operations.

## Key Features

- **Grover's Search Algorithm**: Accelerates unstructured search queries in large databases, providing exponential speedups compared to classical search algorithms.
- **Quantum-Inspired Optimization (QAOA)**: Uses quantum-inspired principles to find the optimal solutions for complex database queries and combinatorial problems.
- **Quantum Clustering**: Enhances classical clustering methods (like KMeans) by using quantum computing, improving clustering performance on large datasets.
  
By using quantum algorithms, we aim to significantly improve the speed and efficiency of traditional database operations, especially for large and complex datasets.

## Algorithms Implemented

### Grover's Search
**Grover's Search** is a quantum algorithm that allows us to search an unsorted database more efficiently. In classical computing, searching a database of **N** items requires **O(N)** time, but Grover's algorithm can search it in **O(√N)** time, offering a quadratic speedup.

#### Example Code: `grover_search.py`
```python
# Grover's Search Algorithm for Database Search Optimization

from qiskit import Aer, QuantumCircuit, transpile, assemble
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram

N = 16  # Database size (Number of items)
target_index = 5  # The target index we are searching for

# Create a quantum circuit with N qubits
qc = QuantumCircuit(N)

# Create a superposition of all possible states
qc.h(range(N))

# Oracle: Mark the target state
qc.cz(target_index, target_index)

# Diffusion operator (Inversion about the mean)
qc.h(range(N))
qc.x(range(N))
qc.h(N-1)
qc.cx(range(N-1), N-1)
qc.h(range(N))
qc.x(range(N))

# Measure the result
qc.measure_all()

# Simulate the circuit
backend = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
tqc = transpile(qc, backend)
qobj = assemble(tqc)
result = backend.run(qobj).result()

# Display the result
counts = result.get_counts()
print(f"Result: {counts}")
plot_histogram(counts)
```

### Quantum-Inspired Optimization (QAOA)
The **Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)** is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm used to solve combinatorial optimization problems. This project uses QAOA to optimize database queries and find optimal solutions to complex problems.

#### Example Code: `optimization.py`
```python
# Quantum-Inspired Optimization using QAOA for Query Optimization

from qiskit import Aer, QuantumCircuit
from qiskit.aqua.algorithms import QAOA
from qiskit.aqua import QuantumInstance
from qiskit.aqua.operators import Z, I
import numpy as np

def optimize_query():
    # Simple problem for QAOA optimization
    circuit = QuantumCircuit(4)

    # Apply QAOA algorithm
    qaoa = QAOA(operator=Z ^ Z ^ I ^ I, p=2)  # Example Hamiltonian (Z and I operators)
    quantum_instance = QuantumInstance(Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator'))

    # Run QAOA to find the optimal solution
    result = qaoa.compute_minimum_eigenvalue()
    return result.eigenvalue.real  # Return the minimum eigenvalue (optimal solution)

# Example usage:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    optimal_value = optimize_query()
    print(f"Optimal solution: {optimal_value}")
```

### Quantum Clustering
**Quantum Clustering** enhances classical clustering algorithms (like KMeans) by integrating quantum mechanics. This project uses a combination of classical KMeans and quantum circuits to optimize clustering for large datasets, making it faster and more accurate.

#### Example Code: `clustering.py`
```python
# Quantum Clustering leveraging quantum principles for clustering data

import numpy as np
from qiskit import Aer, QuantumCircuit
from qiskit.aqua.algorithms import QAOA
from qiskit.aqua import QuantumInstance
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def quantum_clustering(data_points):
    # Apply classical KMeans for initialization
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2, random_state=0).fit(data_points)
    
    # Get the clustering labels and centroids
    labels = kmeans.labels_
    centroids = kmeans.cluster_centers_

    # Create a simple quantum circuit for further clustering optimization
    qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
    qc.h(0)
    qc.cx(0, 1)

    # Simulate the quantum circuit
    backend = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
    quantum_instance = QuantumInstance(backend)
    result = quantum_instance.execute(qc)

    # Plot the results
    plt.scatter(data_points[:, 0], data_points[:, 1], c=labels)
    plt.scatter(centroids[:, 0], centroids[:, 1], color='red', marker='X')
    plt.title('Quantum Clustering Results')
    plt.show()

# Example usage with random data:
data = np.random.rand(100, 2)
quantum_clustering(data)
```
